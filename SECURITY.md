## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. Thank you for improving the security of Vyft.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
2. **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers through GitHub discussions

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information (optional)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and deployed

### Security Scope

We consider the following as security issues:

- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Authentication and authorization bypasses
- Data exposure or leakage
- Infrastructure deployment vulnerabilities
- Supply chain security issues
- Denial of service vulnerabilities

### What We Don't Consider Security Issues

- Issues that require physical access to the system
- Social engineering attacks
- Issues in dependencies that don't affect Vyft's core functionality
- Denial of service through resource exhaustion (unless it's a design flaw)

### Recognition

We maintain a security hall of fame to recognize security researchers who help improve Vyft's security. Contributors will be listed (with permission) in our documentation.

### Security Best Practices

When using Vyft:

- Always use the latest version
- Review and validate infrastructure configurations before deployment
- Use proper authentication and access controls
- Keep your deployment environment secure
- Monitor for unusual activity
